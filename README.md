# -Dundas-Square-Removable-Arm-Desk-Redesign
Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to prototype an innovative reverse-engineered design for an effective DSQ desk, aimed at enhancing the lecture experience at the Yonge and Dundas Cineplex.
Identified key issues with the current DSQ desk that negatively impact students' learning experiences and the university's image, particularly the lack of support for left-handed users. 
Conducted comprehensive research, applied mathematical concepts, and iterated through several CAD models to develop an optimized prototype.
