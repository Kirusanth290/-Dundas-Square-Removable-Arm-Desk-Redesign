Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to prototype an innovative reverse-engineered design for an effective DSQ desk, aimed at enhancing the lecture experience at the Yonge and Dundas Cineplex. Identified key issues with the current DSQ desk that negatively impact students' learning experiences and the university's image, particularly the lack of support for left-handed users. 
Conducted comprehensive research, applied mathematical concepts, and iterated through several CAD models to develop an optimized prototype.

Improved stability through compressibility builds (benefits for long lectures and exam writing). Accommodation for left-hand users with the use of double cap support & reaction mechanism. Takes advantage of including a more inclusive and eco-friendly experience for all since it's made of compostable bioplastic which reduces waste created by the product.
Product of several iterations
